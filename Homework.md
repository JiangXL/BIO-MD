**Q**: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) derive directly from aortic endothelial cells
in both zebrafish and mouse embryos (ventral wall of dorsal aorta, Lecture 14
p53-58). In zebrafish, about 10 HSC emerges by the endothelial hematopoietic
transition, while HSC markers, for example, runx1 and c-myb, are expressed in
ventral wall of dorsal aorta throughout trunk. So why only few endothelial cells
in aorta will become HSC and most endothelial cells keep their fate? Please
propose a testable hypothesis to explain this.

**Q**: In our class, I mentioned several times that model organisms are similar to
human more or less to some extension. However, we are different. So in your
opinion, what's the biggest difference between human and animals? 

**A**: Biggest difference is the complex and organized activites in brain, which
form morality and ability to get a very big view of universe. Kant said in the
past, “Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more
often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry
heavens above me and the moral law within me”. Although biological view of these
is not cleary, it still push everyone to think it.
