# 20. Regeneration
Regeneration is a homeostatic process that maintains
or restores the original architecture and function of a
tissue after damage in adult animal.

## Morphallaxis and epimorphosis

>Morphallaxis is often contrasted with epimorphosis, which is characterized by a much greater relative degree of cellular proliferation. Although cellular differentiation is active in both processes, in morphallaxis the majority of the regeneration comes from reorganization or exchange, while in epimorphosis the majority of the regeneration comes from cellular **differentiation**. Thus, the two may be distinguished as a measure of **degree**. Epimorphosis is the regeneration of a part of an organism by proliferation at the cut surface. For example, in Planaria neoblasts help in regeneration.[1]

## Qusetions
Major questions
• 1. What is the origin of the cells that give rise to
the regenerated structures?
• 2. What mechanisms pattern the regenerated
tissue?
• 3. How are these related to the patterning
processes that occur in embryogenesis?
• 4. What are the factors that regulate these
activities?
