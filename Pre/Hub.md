>A cell-free system is an in vitro tool widely used to study biological reactions
that happen within cells apart from a full cell system, thus reducing the complex
interactions typically found when working in a whole cell.

Youth serum for real?

Old mice thrive when their circulatory systems are linked with those of younger mice, for reasons not yet clear.
This year, in work with profound implications for aging, researchers showed that blood or blood components from a young mouse can rejuvenate an old mouse's muscles and brain. If the results hold up in people—an idea already in testing—factors in young blood could offer the antidote to aging that humanity has sought as far back as Juan Ponce de León's quest for the Fountain of Youth.

These findings grew out of strange-sounding experiments dating back 150 years, in which researchers sew together the skins of two mice to join their circulation. In the early 2000s, the approach was revived to study stem cells. Researchers found that when they connected the circulation of young and old mice, the muscle stem cells in the old mice were better able to regenerate muscle.

Work published in 2014 strengthened the evidence that something in young blood can reverse multiple signs of aging. One group studied a factor isolated from young mouse blood called GDF11, which had already been shown to rejuvenate the heart. They found that it can also boost the muscle strength and endurance of an old mouse and spur neuron growth in the brain. Another team reported that young blood, or even cell-free blood plasma, bolsters an aging mouse's spatial memory.

Now, in the first clinical trial, 18 middle-aged and elderly Alzheimer's patients are receiving injections of plasma donated by young adults. By this time next year, we may know if young blood can fight one of the most feared diseases of aging. –Jocelyn Kaiser
