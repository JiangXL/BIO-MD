## Work of GDF11

In 2013, Wa gers,Lee, and their colleagues reported in Cell that injection of
GDF11 alone has the same effect on the hearts of old mice as an infusion of young
blood: It significantly __reversed cardiac enlargement__(心脏肿大) (hypertrophy),
which　often causes the kind of heart failure comm only seen in older people.

And this spring(2014), in two papers in _Science_, **Wagers Lee**, and their
colleagues showed that raising GDF11 to youthful levels rejuvenated muscle stem
cells, reversing age-related impairments and producing greater strength and
endurance in older mice.

Working with **Rubin**, they also reported that GDF11 bolstered circulation in older
mouse brains, which promoted the formation of new neurons and ultimately improved
brain function.


## Points for other scientists of GDF11

>“It’s obviously a fas-cinating idea that somet hing in the blood
can potentially reverse aging,” says **Toren Finkel**, who heads the Center
for Mo lecu-lar Me dicine at the Na tional He art, Lung, and Blood
Institute in Bet hesda, Maryland. “That’ s sort of the **holy grail** for aging
research.… But you’d like to know how these things work, what the mechanism is.”

>**Other researchers** caution that the work still need tos to be reproducted and
note that growth factors have the potential to initiate or accelerate cancers.

>  Wagers suspects injecting GDF11 directly into pat ients would be “not ideal,”
because such an approach would bypass the tight biological regulat ion go vern-
ing the molecu le and perhaps increase the risk of side effect s. “Minimally, we
could use it as a biomarke r for predicting outcome” and monitoring other
treatments for age-related conditions.
Citing unpublished data on nearly 2000 elderly heart pat ients followed for
roughly 9 years, for example, Peter Ganz of UC SanFrancisco and colleagues have
report ed at meet ings that lower levels of GDF11 in the blood predicted higher
rates of heart attack, sroke , congestive heart failure, and overall mortality.

## Other Factors
Th is is a complicated and robust system of regulation, so there’s likely multiple
signals.” Indeed, Rando’s lab at Stanford has been pursuing blood-borne factors
in older mice that seem to suppress stem cell activity and blunt their regenerative
capacity. Conboy’s lab at UC Berkeley has recently reported that levels of the
hormone oxytocin in the blood decline with age, and increased amounts of oxytocin
(催产素)seem to play a major role in activating adult　muscle stem cells and
improving muscle regeneration. And Wyss-Coray and colleagues reported this past
May in _Nature Medicine_ that infusions of “young blood plasma” reversed the
neural and cognitive impairments of old mice—largely by rejuvenating the function
of synapses. “Interestingly, none of us ended up with the same pathway of this"

## Application
Stanford doctors plan to begin transfusing plasma from young blood donors into
patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and Conboy says clinical test ing of oxytocin,
already a Food and Drug Administration–approved drug, and other blood-borne
factors are under discussion by UC Berkeley scientists.


**“You want to be enthusiastic about the potential, the real potential of the
science,” she continues. “On the other hand, you have to turn around and say,
‘But not yet.’ It’s just areally hard message —to be clear that the hope is real,
but that it will take time, and we can’ t tell you the path to get there.”**
